### **Traditional, Contemporary, Modern Pages**
- These should be individual sections that display information about each calligraphy style. Each page could include:
  - A brief description of the style
  - History and significance
  - Example images or fonts in that style (with a button linking to the gallery filtered for that style)

---

### **Key Points for Clarity & Adjustments**
1. **Routing:** 
   - Use React Router for seamless navigation across these sections and pages (e.g., Home, About Us, Gallery, Feedback).
   - Ensure the buttons or links in sections like **Gallery** and **About Us** navigate to their respective routes.

2. **Navigation:**
   - First navbar should be sticky for easy access.
   - Second navbar could have smooth scrolling to each style section if it’s on the same page, or link to dedicated style pages if you prefer.

3. **Section Layout:**
   - Make sure each section has padding/margins for clean spacing.
   - Each section (Gallery, About Us, etc.) can be divided with full-width background colors to distinguish them.

4. **Responsiveness:**
   - Use media queries or flexbox/grid to rearrange content based on screen size.
   - Ensure the feedback section’s form moves into the footer on larger screens (desktop view).
